# RNN_TextClassofocation
This project demonstrates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for classifying text into predefined categories. RNNs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as text, due to their ability to maintain context over sequences.


# Text Classification with RNNs

## Project Description

This project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify text documents into predefined categories. RNNs are effective for sequential data, such as text, due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.

### Objective

To build and train an RNN model for text classification using a dataset of text documents. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

### Dataset

The dataset includes text documents labeled with their respective categories. For demonstration purposes, you can use:
- **IMDB Reviews** for sentiment analysis.
- **20 Newsgroups** for topic classification.

### Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains text data files and scripts for data loading and preprocessing.
- **`models/`**: Contains code for defining and training the RNN model.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model architecture, and training.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the code.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- NLTK or other text processing libraries

Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
